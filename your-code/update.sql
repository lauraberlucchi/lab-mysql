-- To avoid repeating the same query for multiple times, I tried to use the conditional CASE statement.
-- With that I tell SQL to update the table customers in the email field with the given email addresses if the 3 condition are satisfied (WHEN...THEN).
-- Specifying the rows where the operation is perfomerd with WHERE is necessary, otherwise error 1175 will be raised (You are using safe update mode and you tried to update a table without a WHERE that uses a KEY column).
